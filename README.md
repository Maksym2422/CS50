# CS50 Solutions and Projects

This repository contains my solutions and projects completed as part of the [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) course offered by Harvard University. I completed the course on the [Prometheus](https://prometheus.org.ua/) platform.

## Contents

- **Problem Sets:** Solutions to the weekly problem sets assigned during the course.
- **Final Project:** My final project, which is a culmination of what I learned during the course.

## How to Use

Each folder corresponds to a different problem set or project. Inside each folder, you will find:

- The source code (`.c`, `.py`, etc.)
- A `README.md` file explaining the problem and the approach taken to solve it.

## Prerequisites

To run the code, you may need the following:

- **CS50 Library:** Install the CS50 library for C programs. Instructions can be found [here](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/libraries/cs50/c/).
